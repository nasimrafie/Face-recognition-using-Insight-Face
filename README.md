# Face-recognition-using-Insight-Face
I developed a TensorFlow-based model that recognizes and detects faces using the InsightFace algorithm. The model efficiently identifies facial features and detects faces in images, providing accurate and real-time facial recognition for various applications such as security and user interaction.
